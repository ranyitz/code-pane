# code pane

A very rough POC I created in order to create PNG files of code snippets for presentations

## Why?

It's very common to show code within presentations, in which you'd like to highlight specific lines.

This project takes inspiration from the amazing https://carbon.now.sh/. It has many things that I like, but also some that I would like to improve. The syntax highlighting is often broken, the line highlighting functionality is not working correctly, it's impossibly to remove the rounded corners.

I feel that I want to create something simpler and more refined. While it's cool to edit the code and than export it, I think it would be a bit simpler to paste the code in one place and preview in another.

## Future plans

- Support multiple themes
- Support multiple languages
- Design appropriatly
- Support multiple export sizes
- Support multiple export formats (SVG/JPEG)
- Configure file name
- Support copy to clipboard
- ctrl+a should capture only the code
- Export for twitter
- Round corners (configured)
- Remove line numbers (configured)
- Support multiple fonts/sizes/line-heights
- Support adjusting pane width
- Support presets & saved configuration + local storage
- Support drop shadow
- Support better code editing experience
- Support shift + click for highlighting multiple lines
